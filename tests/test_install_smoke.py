"""Dependency drift smoke tests — NOT mocked.

Most pipeline tests mock out `spikeinterface.sorters.run_sorter` and
`spikeinterface.preprocessing.correct_motion`, which means the test suite
passes green even when torch / kilosort are NOT actually installed. That
gap allowed a real production-bug to ship: after `uv sync` normalised the
venv to match `pyproject.toml`, the previously-dirty dev env lost torch
and kilosort, and the preprocess stage started failing at runtime with::

    Motion estimation failed. The dredge method require torch: pip install torch

These tests are the forcing function that protects against that drift.

**Current contract** (post GPU redesign, 2026-04): ``torch`` and ``kilosort``
are deliberately NOT listed in ``pyproject.toml`` — they are installed
out-of-band by ``tools/install_sort_stack.py`` so that ``uv sync --inexact``
leaves the selected CUDA build alone. That means these real-import
tests fail when a fresh clone has not yet run the installer. Fix it with::

    uv run python tools/install_sort_stack.py

    # From then on, use --inexact to preserve the sort stack:
    uv sync --inexact --extra ui --extra gpu --extra plots

If you actually want to run only discover/export (no sort, no motion
correction), deselect this file with::

    uv run pytest --deselect tests/test_install_smoke.py
