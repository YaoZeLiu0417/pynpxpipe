"""torch_env.py — Runtime CUDA/torch consistency check.

pynpxpipe deliberately does NOT declare ``torch`` or ``kilosort`` in
``pyproject.toml``. They are installed by ``tools/install_sort_stack.py``
once and then left alone by ``uv sync --inexact``. See that script for the why.

This module provides the stage-side runtime check: given the user's
configured ``torch_device`` and the detected GPU state, decide what to do.

Behavior matrix:

    torch_device | physical GPU | torch.cuda.is_available() | action
    ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------
    cpu          | any          | any                       | → "cpu"
    auto         | no           | any                       | → "cpu"
    auto         | yes          | True                      | → "cuda"
    auto         | yes          | False                     | WARN + → "cpu"   (torch is CPU build)
    cuda         | no           | any                       | raise (misconfiguration)
    cuda         | yes          | True                      | → "cuda"
    cuda         | yes          | False                     | raise (torch is CPU build)

The "warn and fall back" branch only fires for ``auto``. When the user
explicitly asks for ``cuda`` and torch is a CPU build, we raise — this is
exactly the silent-failure mode that motivated the redesign.
